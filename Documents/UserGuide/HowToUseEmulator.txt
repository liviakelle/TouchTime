For Christopher McDonald / Whoever may want to run this on an emulator:

Install Android Studio and open the project TouchTime on it

Install an android emulator from Tools -> Android -> AVD Manager
We used an Android Wear Round API 26 for our emulation - the recommended one to install.

Select "RUN" (the green play button) from the upper menu in Android Studio.
If no available virtual device from the select deployment target window, create a new virtual device.
Once you have an available AVD, select it and press ok.
	If the deployment target doesn't come up, but it's a window asking you to change configurations...
	make sure that gradle has completed its sync - usually just requires waiting a minute.

If the dog indicating our application does not show on the watch face, swipe right-to-left to access
the watch face selection menu - our application will be on the bottom of the list.
NOTE - the application will be showing you the time at UTC 00:00. 

Make sure to bring up the "4: Run" panel from the bottom left of Android Studio.
This panel will display the logcat messages that we use to display the vibrations produced.
