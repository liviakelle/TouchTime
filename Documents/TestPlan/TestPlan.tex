\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document will serve as the basis for the verification and validation of our program through testing. During and after the implementation of our software we will use this plan as a reference for which tests we will perform, how the tests will be performed, and the results that we expect for our tests.

\subsection{Scope}
Tests of the functional and non-functional requirements in the SRS will be completed in this project and outlined in this document. The aim is to perform a variety of tests, from functional vs structural, static vs dynamic, and automatic vs manual. On a smaller level, unit testing will be completed to test the functionality of individual methods. Utilizing many different testing styles has the advantage of testing different aspects of the application.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
This document will be outlining our plans for testing of the TouchTime software. Described below are our approaches to testing, tools to be used, and plans for system and unit tests. TouchTime is not an indredibly complex software so there is a limited amount of functions that can be tested, however a large portion of our testing will involve non-functional testing to make sure that it meets the requirements and expectations of our users.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
TouchTime is an Android smart-watch application that enables users to know the time through vibration patterns, for the visually impaired or anyone that would like to be able to tell the time without having to look at the screen. Users interact with the application through tapping the watch face. Tapping on the left side of the screen will result in the vibration patterns corresponding to the hour; the right side of the screen will indicate the minutes.


\subsection{Test Team}
The software will be tested by Matthew Po, Evan Ansell, and Livia Kelle. 

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
The software will be tested using the JUnit testing framework against an emulator that is running the TouchTime software. Each vibration sent by the code to the watch emulator will be logged into logcat in Android Studio. We can use JUnit to assert that the logs are being sent, which is an implication that the code has successfully executed and the watch is vibrating. Note that the test cases are being used to test against the software telling the watch to vibrate, and not used to test the emulators response (i.e. the physical vibration). 

\subsection{Testing Tools}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Vibration Test on Screen Touch}
		
\paragraph{Vibrate Pattern Left Screen}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-fl1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application installed and launched on Android smartwatch. 
					
Input: User touches left half of watch emulator.
					
Output: Distinct vibration pattern for hour hand. Logcat log to indicate the screen has responded to the touch and vibration has occurred.  
					
How test will be performed: Compare Logcat log pattern to pattern that should have occurred at the given hour. Repeat at various hour times, such as 12, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10. 
					
\item{test-fl2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automatic
					
Initial State: Application installed and launched on Android smartwatch. 
					
Input: Simulated touch on left half of watch emulator.
					
Output: Distinct vibration pattern for hour hand. Logcat log to indicate the screen has responded to the touch and vibration has occurred.  
					
How test will be performed: Automatically compare Logcat log pattern to pattern that should have occurred at the given hour. Repeat at every hour for 12 hours.

\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Vibrate Pattern Right Screen}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-fr1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application installed and launched on Android smartwatch. 
					
Input: User touches right half of watch emulator.
					
Output: Distinct vibration pattern for minute hand. Logcat log to indicate the screen has responded to the touch and vibration has occurred.  
					
How test will be performed: Compare Logcat log pattern to pattern that should have occurred at the given hour. Repeat at various minutes, such as 00, 01, 09, 15, 20, 29, 45, 55, 59. 
					
\item{test-fr2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automatic
					
Initial State: Application installed and launched on Android smartwatch. 
					
Input: Simulated touch on right half of watch emulator.
					
Output: Distinct vibration pattern for minute hand. Logcat log to indicate the screen has responded to the touch and vibration has occurred.  
					
How test will be performed: Automatically compare Logcat log pattern to pattern that should have occurred at the given hour. Repeat every minute for one hour.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Abnormal Situations}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-fa1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application installed and launched on Android smartwatch. 
					
Input: User touches left half of watch emulator and then right half before hours are fully indicated through vibrations.
					
Output: Distinct vibration pattern for hour and minute hand. Logcat log to indicate the screen has responded to the left touch and vibration has occurred, but stops upon right touch.
					
How test will be performed: Compare Logcat log pattern to pattern that should have occurred at the hour and minute. See where hour pattern was cut off and determine if minutes were correctly indicated at that point. 
					
\item{test-fr2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application installed and launched on Android smartwatch. 
					
Input: User touches left half of watch emulator at 11:59 and hours are indicated. User then touches the right half after the time changes to 12:00.
					
Output: Distinct vibration pattern for hour and minute hand. Logcat log to indicate the screen has responded to the left and right touch and vibration has occurred.
					
How test will be performed: Compare Logcat log pattern to pattern that should have occurred at the hour and minute. The time indicated should be 11:00 due to this timing error, as the user will receive the hour vibration pattern for 11:59 and the minute vibration pattern for 12:00. This is an incorrect but expected behavior that will be corrected in future revision.

\item{test-fr3\\}

Type: Structural, Dynamic, Automatic
					
Initial State: Application installed and launched on Android smartwatch. 
					
Input: Simulated simultaneous touch on both left and right halves of watch emulator.
					
Output: Expected: Exception.
					
How test will be performed: A computer-driven test. The watch is not able to read out both hour and minute simultaneously, and so an exception should be produced that will be handled. No output should be produced for the user.

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}
The test cases for the functional requirements relating to vibration patterns can be traced directly to SRS 2.2.4 and 2.2.5, which indicate the vibration patterns for the hours and minutes.\\
\newline
For the non-functional requirements, the usability test cases can be traced back to the original usability requirements indicated in the SRS. Tests test-nf-u1 and test-nf-u2 can be traced back to the ease of use requirement 3.2.1, stating that the application shall be usable by anyone capable of touching the screen of a smart watch. The test case test-nf-u3 can be traced back to the ease of learning requirement 3.2.2, stating that the application shall be easy for anyone capable of using a smart watch to use. \\
\newline
In the case of performance, tests test-nf-p1,test-nf-p2, and test-nf-p3 can be traced to the speed requirements 3.3.1. Test-nf-p4 and test-nf-p5 can be traced to the precision requirement 3.3.4, stating the time must be accurate to within one second.

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}
For our Proof of Concept, our objectives are to create an Android Wear application that displays a clock face and responds to distinct touches on the left and right side of the face with a unique vibration pattern for each side. Since it is only a basic application of which we are mostly concerned with the functionality, the early proof of concept tests to be performed are simple manual functional tests.
\subsection{Vibration Test on Screen Touch}
		
\paragraph{Vibration Pattern}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-pc-v1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Application installed and launched on Android smartwatch. Smartwatch connected to laptop running Android Studio.
					
Input: Tap on left side of face (x $<$ 150).
					
Output: Long vibration pattern from watch.
		Long vibration pattern output to Logcat log.
					
How test will be performed: We will tap the left side of the watch face on either the emulator or physical android watch. The expected result is a vibration pattern: long vibration, pause, long vibration, pause. We will be able to verify that this was the expected vibration pattern by looking at the Logcat logs in our Android Studio window.
					
\item{test-pc-v2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.
					
Initial State: Application installed and launched on Android smartwatch. Smartwatch connected to laptop running Android Studio.
					
Input: Tap on right side of face (x $\geq$ 150).
					
Output: Short vibration pattern from watch.
		Short vibration pattern output to Logcat log.
					
How test will be performed: We will tap the right side of the watch face on either the emulator or physical android watch. The expected result is a vibration pattern: short vibration, pause, short vibration, pause. We will be able to verify that this was the expected vibration pattern by looking at the Logcat logs in our Android Studio window.

\end{enumerate}
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
Our TouchTime application will have a different functional implementation than the existing software. As such, direct functional comparisons will be difficult. Despite the different functionalities, our software has the same goal as the existing software, and the nonfunctional requirements (particularly usability and performance) that effect the user's experience will help us compare between the programs.
				
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
The Junit framework supplied with Android Studio will be used to complete unit testing. We will use Junit testing in order to quickly and efficiently perform structural tests, particularly on boundary conditions which may be hard to test manually such as boundary pixels for the left and right sides of the watch face.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
Unit tests for internal functions will be capable of sending input to the functions through simulated gestures. It may be beneficial for us to create a driver that will perform these gestures. The internal functions that we will focus on will be the functions responsible for storing the time which will be read to the user, along with some simple tests such as making sure our pixel boundaries are set up correctly for registering left/right taps, and tests that make sure the application is correctly determining between a tap, short press, and a long press based on our time boundaries. 
		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		
Unit tests for external functions will be capable of reading the output from the Logcat log files. For our methods, we can set certain messages to be sent to the log (such as listing out the vibration pattern sent and the time at which it was recorded). Our unit tests here will be helpful by covering the code for many scenarios and reading the logs to match each output to its expected result. If testing for any time, especially on the boundaries of maximum and minumum time allowed between presses, the vibration patterns should always match with the time being tested.

\section{Appendix}


\subsection{Usability Survey Questions}

Some of our tests will be usability tests. Due to the nature of the application, we will have to provide users with instructions on how to tell the time based on the vibration patterns. These usability tests will be helpful to determine if changes need to be made in order to make our application more user-friendly. \\
Some such questions that would follow system tests with groups of users could be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Were you able to launch the application on the smartwatch without issue?
\item What was the hour that the watch indicated?
\item What was the minute that the watch indicated?
\item Was the application responsive enough for your needs?
\end{itemize}
